## Welcome

This is the home of Tuxcon Technology. We are a small time web and mail host with a focus on two principal aspects.

* Rock solid stability
* Personal relationship with our customers

To that end, each of our plans are tailor-made for each customer after discussing their exact needs. We talk about your requirements, discuss how we can help you achieve them, and settle on a price that works best for both us.

### Services Offered

### Protection

All of our services are protected by our own 4-way backup system. We have daily/weekly/monthly filesystem snapshots available, as well as hourly or daily encrypted offsite backups of key areas (databases, website files, emails), in addition to 2 other offsite deduplicated and encrypted backups for redundancy. Additionally, one of these other offsite backups are again backed up to an offsite location (backups of backups) - you can be assured your key data is being kept safe. 

All of us who work at Tuxcon know the pain data loss causes - this is why we work so hard to keep yours safe. As we are fans of both privacy and transparency, we are happy to discuss any of our methods of backup with you on a personal level, and are also open to discussing specific backup requirements in addition to what we currently have.

### Payment Methods

We can accept payment via:

* Credit Card
* Cheque
* Bank Transfer
* Digital Currencies (Monero, Bitcoin, Litecoin, Vertcoin, Ethereum, and NEO - sometimes referred to as "Cryptocurrencies")

### Contact

Please send an email to **contact** _at_ **tuxcon.com** - we'll get in touch with you from there! Please keep in mind we are not able to respond to emails 24/7 - if you are using a disposable email service (such as GuerillaMail) please keep in mind those inboxes only last for 60 minutes. You can also contact Steve via [Keybase](https://keybase.io/soupyowl) if you want another anonymous, encrypted communication option.
