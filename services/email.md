## Email Access

There are two primary ways to access your email. We provide 2 webmail portals (a modified SquirrelMail, and a plain RoundCube installation), but we also provide (and encourage the use of) IMAPS and POP3S (with IMAPS being the recommendation out of these two).

### Webmail

You can access the [SquirrelMail](https://mail.tuxcon.com) interface [here](https://mail.tuxcon.com), or the [RoundCube](https://mail.tuxcon.com/rc/) interface [here](https://mail.tuxcon.com/rc/).

### Email Client

You can configure your email client with the values listed below:

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr><th>Service</th><th>Value</th></tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>Hostname</td><td>mail.tuxcon.com</td></tr>
		<tr><td>IMAPS Port</td><td>993</td></tr>
		<tr><td>POP3S Port</td><td>995</td></tr>
		<tr><td>SMTPS Port</td><td>465 or 587</td></tr>
		<tr><td>SSL?</td><td>Yes, for all services</td></tr>
		<tr><td>User account for IMAP, POP, SMTP?</td><td>Your email address - user@domain.com</td></tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
